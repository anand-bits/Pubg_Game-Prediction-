## Overview

This project focuses on predicting finish placements for PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) game matches. We've trained a CatBoost Regression model with feature engineering to achieve impressive accuracy metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.08 and R-squared (R2) of 0.9. This README provides an overview of the project, dataset, model performance, and more.

### Key Features

- **Feature Engineering:** Carefully crafted features to enhance model performance.
- **CatBoost Regression:** Utilized the powerful CatBoost algorithm for precise predictions.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved an RMSE of 0.08 and an R2 of 0.9, demonstrating the model's capability.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source:** [PUBG Finish Placement Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karamalhanatleh/analysis-pubg-finish-placement-prediction-3/input?select=train_V2.csv)
- **Description:** This dataset contains PUBG match data, including player statistics, match details, and finish placements.
